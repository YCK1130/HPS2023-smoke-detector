We use LM75 to monitor Celsius temperature.


Python Module Requirements   <br>
```
sudo pip install smbus2
```

We use MQ7 to detect the concentration of CO (carbon monoxide) in the air, measured in ppm (parts per million). Since RPI lacks an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to read the output voltage from the MQ7 Ao pin, we have additionally connected an ADS1115 ADC.

Python Module Requirements

```
sudo pip install adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15
```


The MQ7 carbon monoxide sensor requires preheating (powering up) for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before its measured values become relatively stable.

## Smoke Detecto

For the smoke detector, we use the YDS-H03 smoke sensor. Using an oscilloscope, we identify the appropriate pins that can be connected, and then send the sensor data to the Raspberry Pi (RPI). This setup serves as a basis for detecting fire incidents.

Python Module Requirements   <br>
```
pip install RPi.GPIO
```

## Program


In the folder, there are separate programs for each sensor. Additionally, there is a file named `combine_sensor.py` that integrates the Python files for both sensors. The `test_alarm.py` program is used purely to test whether the GPIO signal from the smoke detector can be successfully read by the Raspberry Pi (RPI).
